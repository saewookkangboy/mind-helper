    "helpSaju": "Saju (Four Pillars) means the four 'pillars' of your birth: year, month, day, and hour. Each pillar is written with one Heavenly Stem and one Earthly Branch (e.g. 甲子), so there are eight characters in total—hence 'Four Pillars, Eight Characters' (四柱八字).\n\nThe stems and branches cycle in 60 combinations. These are then mapped to the five elements (Oheng: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water). From the distribution and your day pillar's element, we interpret temperament and balance. The manseryeok (calendar) is the table used to compute this from your birth date and time.",

    "sajuSourceTitle": "Source for Saju calculation (KARI Lunar-Solar Calendar)",
    "helpPsychology": "In counseling, we look at how thoughts (cognition), emotions, and behavior are linked. When you're stressed or worried, noticing 'what thought led to this feeling' and 'what action followed' helps you see repeating patterns.\n\nIn this analysis, we used such cognitive–emotional–behavioral patterns to shape psychological advice that fits your question and situation. This is not a substitute for professional counseling but is designed to support self-understanding and direction.",
    "detailPsychology": "We present pattern insights and concrete psychological advice you can apply to your current situation. Consider professional counseling if you need more support.",
    "helpTarot": "Tarot is a 78-card system (22 Major Arcana, 56 Minor Arcana) used to read situation, energy, and possibility. The Major Arcana often represents life's larger themes; the Minor Arcana, day-to-day details.\n\nIn this service, we use Major Arcana symbols and meanings alongside your question and other domains (e.g. Saju, psychology) to add an intuitive sense of 'what energy is present' and 'what direction to consider.' Use it as a tool for reflection, not as fortune-telling.",
    "detailTarot": "Tarot symbols and spread interpretation were used to reflect flow and energy relevant to your question. See the Help section for more on card meanings.",
    "helpMbti": "MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) uses four preference dimensions to form 16 personality types.\n\nE (Extraversion) vs I (Introversion): where you get energy—from the outer world or inner world.\nS (Sensing) vs N (Intuition): how you take in information—concrete facts or patterns and possibilities.\nT (Thinking) vs F (Feeling): how you decide—logic and criteria or values and impact on people.\nJ (Judging) vs P (Perceiving): how you organize life—planned and closed or flexible and open.\n\nYour reported type was used to tailor insights and suggestions in the combined result. Types are a framework; individual differences always apply.",

    "helpBirkman": "The Birkman assessment measures behavior style, needs, and stress responses across several dimensions. It helps you understand how you typically act, what you need, and how you react under stress.\n\nIn this analysis, we used Birkman-style dimensions (without a full assessment) to interpret your result together with Saju, MBTI, and psychology. Behavior, needs, and stress reactions are reflected in the combined output.",
    "detailBirkman": "Interpretation based on behavior style, needs, and stress reactions. The full result and Help section explain how to apply this in daily life and relationships.",
    "helpDark": "Dark psychology studies the 'darker' side of human behavior: manipulation, power, persuasion, and defense mechanisms. Understanding how these work is not to harm others but to make wiser choices in relationships and decisions.\n\nThe dark triad refers to Machiavellianism (manipulation), narcissism (self-centeredness), and psychopathy (lack of empathy). In this analysis, we reference these concepts to support your understanding of relationships and decision-making. Use this from a perspective of protecting yourself and others.",
    "detailDark": "We provide reference explanations on the dark triad, persuasion, and defense. Use them to broaden your view of relationships and choices.",
